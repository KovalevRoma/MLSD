# **Cloud-Based System for Unique Visitor Detection**

---

## **Project Overview**
This project focuses on the **design and development of a scalable, cloud-based system** for counting unique customer visits across multiple retail locations. The system is tailored for retail environments to provide actionable insights about customer behavior.

By leveraging modern face recognition and data aggregation techniques, this solution enables businesses to:
1. Understand customer visit frequency patterns.
2. Identify and track unique visitors across multiple store locations.
3. Optimize store layouts and improve marketing strategies.

**Why it matters**:
- With millions of retail locations and hundreds of millions of cameras worldwide, managing and analyzing such vast data volumes is critical for actionable business intelligence.
- The project ensures accurate, reliable, and scalable analytics that can cater to small retailers and large enterprises alike.

---

## **Business Objectives**
### **Key Deliverables**
1. **Customer Visit Frequency Analytics**:
   - Provide detailed reports on customer visit patterns to help improve engagement.
2. **Accurate Visitor Identification Across Locations**:
   - Ensure precise counting of unique visitors across multiple stores, avoiding duplication.
3. **Scalable Solution**:
   - Handle high volumes of real-time data from millions of cameras distributed globally.

---

## **Technical Task**
### **Objective**
Develop a **cloud-based system** that generates a list of unique visitors over a specified time period. For each visitor, the system should provide:
- Number of appearances.
- Cross-location tracking.
- A time-based, location-specific report.

---

## **Functional Requirements**
1. **Time-Based Filtering**:
   - Filter visitor data by specified time periods (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly).
2. **Cross-Camera Aggregation**:
   - Match and count the same visitor across different cameras and locations.
3. **Visit Frequency Count**:
   - Count the total number of visits per unique visitor.

---

## **Scalability Requirements**
1. **Camera Coverage**:
   - Support up to 100 million cameras across multiple global locations.
2. **Visitor Volume**:
   - Efficiently handle data for millions of unique visitors while maintaining high performance.

---

## **Expected Outcome**
The system will produce a **time-bound, location-specific report** that lists:
- Unique visitors.
- Their respective visit counts.
- Locations visited.
- Visit frequency per location.

### **Example Report**
| **Visitor ID** | **Total Appearances** | **Locations Visited** | **Visit Frequency per Location** |
|----------------|------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------|
| 00123A         | 15                    | Store #101, Store #203 | Store #101: 8, Store #203: 7     |
| 08786B         | 10                    | Store #105            | Store #105: 10                   |
| 04567C         | 12                    | Store #101, Store #106 | Store #101: 6, Store #106: 6     |
| 07654D         | 18                    | Store #205, Store #206 | Store #205: 12, Store #206: 6    |

## **How the System Works**
### **Workflow**
1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**:
   - Raw data is captured from camera feeds and processed for consistency.
   - Preprocessed face images are prepared for recognition and analytics.
   
2. **Face Detection**:
   - Lightweight detection models identify faces and extract bounding boxes.
   
3. **Face Recognition**:
   - Generate embeddings to identify and match unique visitors.
   - Match visitors across locations to aggregate data.

4. **Data Storage**:
   - Store visitor data in a cloud-based, scalable database for quick access.

5. **Visualization**:
   - Generate reports with visual and statistical summaries.

## **Scalable Design**
The system is designed with scalability in mind:
- **Distributed Processing**:
   - Break down the workload across multiple nodes to handle large-scale data streams.
- **Optimized Database Structure**:
   - Use efficient relational and vector databases for fast queries and embedding searches.
